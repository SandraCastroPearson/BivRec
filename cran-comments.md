## Resubmission

Examples were modified to run in 3 to 8 seconds. Examples that take longer run time are wrapped in \dontrun{}.  

All NOTES have been fixed except one about possible spelling errors in the description. These are false positives for mispelled words and authors would like to keep as is.
