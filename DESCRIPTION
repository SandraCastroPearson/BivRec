Description: An implementation of three methods to analyze bivariate recurrent event data. 
    The first two methods, "Lee.All" and "Chang", focus on the estimation of covariate effects on the two alternating events/gap times (xij and yij) using semiparametric approaches. 
    The last method, "Non-Parametric", can be used to estimate the joint cdf for the two alternating events/gap times (xij and yij) as well as the marginal survival for the first recurrent event/gap time (xij) and the conditional cdf of the second recurrent event/gap time (yij) given the first event (xij) in a non-parametric fashion. 
    The package provide options to plot the data and the estimates of marginal survival and conditional probability.
