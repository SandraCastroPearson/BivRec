Description: Alternating recurrent event data arise frequently in biomedical and social sciences where 2 types of events such as hospital admissions and discharge occur alternatively over time. 
    As such we implement a collection of non-parametric and semiparametric methods to analyze such data. 
Details:
    The main functions are summarized as follows:  
    biv.rec.fit: Use for estimation of covariate effects on the two alternating event gap times (xij and yij) using semiparametric methods. The method options are "Lee.et.all" and "Chang".  
    biv.rec.np:  Used to estimate the joint cumulative distribution funtion (cdf) for the two alternating events gap times (xij and yij) as well as the marginal survival function for type I gap time (xij) and the conditional cdf of the type II gap times (yij) given an interval in type I gap times (xij) in a non-parametric fashion.   
    The package also provide options to plot the data, and the estimates of teh joint cummulative distribution fuction (cdf), marginal survival function, and the conditional (cdf).
